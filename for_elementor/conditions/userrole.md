### 1. User Role
##### What is the User role condition?

Itâ€™s a user role-based condition, that allows you to display content based on different user roles on your website.

Basically, WPCondify collects your user role from WordPress within the User Role condition and displays your condition-wise contents.

##### How to use it?

* Edit your pages with Elementor
* Select Widget/column/section
* Click on Advanced Tab
* Scroll down and click on Condify Tab
* Enable Apply option
* Now select the User Role condition and set your content.
