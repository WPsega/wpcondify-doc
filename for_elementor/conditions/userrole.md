###### What is the User role condition?

Itâ€™s a user role-based condition, that allows you to display content based on different user roles on your website.

###### How to use it?

* Edit your pages with Elementor
* Select Widget/column/section
* Click on Advanced Tab
* Scroll down and click on Condify Tab
* Enable Apply option
* Now select the User Role condition and set your content.
